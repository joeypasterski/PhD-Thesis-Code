This code was developed for my PhD thesis. 

Annotated code is in Multimodal_ML_v2.RMD file. This includes supervized ML code for ToF-SIMS datasets and unsupervized code for SEM-EDS datasets. 

ToF-SIMS data is labelled as data_and_results for these files. This includes values of the selected tof-sim spectra peaks (int files) for integrated peak area (area) and recorded peak height (height). The full output for the ML cross validation of the four featured models is also present in the Machine Learning 2_Cross Validation Results document.
